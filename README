This is just a plain HTML5 Boilerplate setup for Sinatra using Erector and SASS + Compass, without converting the actual HTML5 Boilerplate into that (for easy upgrading to future versions).

The HTML5 Boilerplate was placed into the public-directory, the index.html moved to views/layout.erb with a little erb added to it. The standard style.css was just moved into views/stylesheets/html5boilerplate.scss without any modifications done to it.
